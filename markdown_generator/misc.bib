    abstract = {Today, October 1, 2020, the Gardner Agricultural Policy program, the farmdoc project, and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) are officially launching the Cover Crop Analyzer, a decision support tool designed to help Illinois farmers manage cover crops in their fields. The tool can be accessed here or through the farmdoc website. The project has been generously funded by the Illinois Nutrient Research \& Education Council (NREC), as well as receiving seed funding from the McKnight Foundation and the University of Illinois. Additional features for the tool are currently under development and will be forthcoming thanks to funding from the Walton Family Foundation. This article reviews the tool and provides background information for users.},

    abstract = {On October 1, 2020, the Gardner Agriculture Policy program and farmdoc, in conjunction with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) and researchers with Purdue University’s Agronomy Department, released a first-of-its-kind, web-based decision support tool for cover crop management in Illinois fields. The project has been funded by the Illinois Nutrient Research \& Education Council (NREC). The Walton Family Foundation provided funding to add additional functionality to the cover crop tool that simulates the decomposition of a terminated cover crop, building on research by Purdue University’s Agronomy Department. Today’s article discusses the recent release of this new functionality in the cover crop tool.},
